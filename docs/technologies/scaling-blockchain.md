# Scaling the blockchain

Encrypted 3-tier network with UDP layer. The UDP layer is used to scale the realtime properties of the network, while significantly decreasing the network latency and easing the load on TCP channels. Proof-of-Stake interest \(0.7%\) is used to secure the network and recoup destroyed transaction fees, creating long term low inflation, which will reach 1% annual rate in 2019. You can read more about it in the whitepaper [Scaling the blockchain](https://github.com/openvcash/papers/blob/master/scaling_the_blockchain.pdf).
