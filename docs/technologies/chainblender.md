# ChainBlender

Client-side blending system. Forms a single transaction from multiple parties by merging similar inputs and outputs, and relaying these operations in an encrypted manner between the participants. The middleman is reduced to a blind relay and the participants are unable to reconstruct the original inputs from the blended transaction. You can read more about it in the whitepaper [ChainBlender](https://github.com/openvcash/papers/blob/master/chainblender.pdf).
