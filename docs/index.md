# Welcome to the Vcash Community Docs

Vcash is a [cryptographic-currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) previously known as Vanillacoin released on December 23rd 2014. Vcash shares the same basic network and cryptographic principles as Bitcoin. The code is written in a backwards compatible but modern approach using C++11. It was built over a period of several years using Peercoin's Proof-of-Stake and Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work consensus as a reference implementation, bringing an alternative codebase to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
